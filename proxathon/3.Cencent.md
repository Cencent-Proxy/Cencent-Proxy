## UI
### homepage (5/5): [x]
Pretty flashy
### overall (10/10): [x]
## UX
### digestability (4/5): [x]
Usage is easy and self explanatory, except that remove frame button, I still cant figure out what it does and it only does something half the time
### usability (2/15:) [x]
2, text constantly shifting pages, weird toolbar, collapse button blocks inspect buttons text if you have an RTL page, and if you click blob cloaking, it has two toolbars? one of the toolbars overlaps the other? Very disapointing
### overall (6/10): [x]
Easy to understand, feels pretty terrible to use
## power user
lacking in stuff other proxies, questionable lack of about:blank cloaking, no real themeing options,
### overall (1/10): [x]
## creativity
Looks cool, but doesn't seem to impliment anything special that other proxies didn't have. Sure it has eruda, but that isn't anything special, and the mobile adjascent UI bugs me.
### overall (5/10): [x]
## out-of-card judgements
Nothing more to add
### overall (0/25) [x]

## final thoughts
Very underwhelming and quite dissapointing, lacks the essence of what I'd expect, and even lacks stuff contained in non poweruser proxies like metallic.
