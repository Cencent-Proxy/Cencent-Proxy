## UI


### Homepage (3.2/5)

It's pretty simple honestly, it gets the job done but it isn't perfect. If you resize your window some of the animations in the different pages such as "Themes" break apart. In the Apps page, the icons aren't even transparent. Along with that, in the Settings page the lines aren't evenly spaced.

## UX

### Digestability (5/5)

It's very simple and just works.

### Usability (11.5/15)

It works but it's not perfect. The Inspect element that appears at the top of the screen isn't very pretty to a new user; nor simple. But hey; as a proxy I guess it works.

## Creativity (1.8/5)

It's simple; nothing too special about it.

### overall (6.9/10)

## out-of-card judgements

The SearXNG instance that is being used for the search is probably fedded. sometimes the animations bug out due to window size. 

### overall (17/25)

## final thoughts

It's the simplest proxy you can get pretty much; it's good at that but pretty much that only.
